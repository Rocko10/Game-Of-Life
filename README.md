# The-Game-Of-Life
This is my implementation of The Game of Life created John Horton Conway.

You can start and stop the game, generate a random board, or customize it by clicking in the cells (board rectangles).

This implementation was made with ReactJS.

To start the application, just run a server in any port and any IP.
